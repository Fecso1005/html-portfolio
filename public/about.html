<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I just started to learn how to build websites. Actualy this is my first website.
  I am an economist btw and working at a bank for 16 years as back office manager and product support specialist, but nowadays my job is 
  pretty boring, that's why i am trying to look for something, that can be interesting and maybe useful later.</p>

<p>I like fishing or taking long walks in the woods, picking mushrooms, and other similar things when i can a little be alone.</p>

<p>I dont have serious plan with this new skill, but... Who knows? I have to work at least 25 years from now.</p>
